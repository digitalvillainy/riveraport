            Hello Everyone!
          </h1>
          <span className="text-lg font-bold text-cyan-400">
            Looking for someone that can make something for the web? I love making things for the web!
          </span>
          <p className="mt-2 mb-4">
            I have been a web developer since 2018, and during that time I have had the privilege to work for a variety of clients.
            From web apps that help streamline a process to web sites that bring in customers, I not only build the things that clients want,
            I build the things that their business needs.
          </p>
          <p className="my-2">
            As a self-taught developer, I make it my business to stay on top of current trends in technology and have learned the value in being
            flexible. I am always on the look-out for the right tool for the right job. That may mean I work on a LAMP stack one week or use a light-weight
            framework like Alpinejs on simple static pages. Regardless, Iâ€™m always excited to find a new challenge.
